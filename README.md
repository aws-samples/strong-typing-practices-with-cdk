# STRONG TYPING PRACTICES WITH CDK

**Note: This project is no longer actively maintained, please consider it for reference purposes only.**

This project is shows a small example of how types can be used to declare a large number of infrastructure resources in a safe and concise manner.

This code example is best understood when paired with this [blog post](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/using-strong-typing-practices-to-declare-a-large-number-of-resources-with-aws-cdk/).

If you're new to CDK you can follow the fantastic [CDK workshop tutorial](https://cdkworkshop.com) to get familiar with the framework.

## Useful commands

 * `npm run build`   compile typescript to js
 * `npm run watch`   watch for changes and compile
 * `npm run test`    perform the jest unit tests
 * `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
 * `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
 * `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
